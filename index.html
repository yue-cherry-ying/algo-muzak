      Row, Row, Row your boat
      <br>
      In the digital world
      <br>
      Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
      <br>
      Sail your trouble away.

      The turbulence and chaos in the world today have far exceeded the
      ups-and-downs of the wave. Each one of us is like a passenger on
      the boat which floats with the current. We cannot control what’s
      going on around us, and we certainly do not have the power to pacify
      the turbulence. We are all in this hard time together. Many of our daily
      activities have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, by the Gorge
      Floyd incident, and by the social distancing guidelines.

      Now, more than ever, digital tools become one of the necessities in our
      lives. We use zoom for classes, use Netflix for entertainment, and use
      Facebook for communications. In the digital world, we see the emergence
      of utopia. This piece is devoted to representing the technology-centered
      idealism — it creates a place where harmonic music is generated automatically
      to please ourselves, and where perfect and pure mathematical equations are
      calculated in the wave functions to satisfy our eyes.
